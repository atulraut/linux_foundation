Below list of issues I found with SyzKaller - 

1] Issue - Failed to ssh into qemu
Why - Didn't created ssh key
Fix
- generate an SSH key pair, using ssh-keygen command

2] Issue - Failed to compile syzkaller
After ﬁring make command, it used to exit in a minute.
Fix - Was using some older laptop/machine, switch to latest hardware.

3] Issue - Missing reproducer
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference in __io_remove_buffers
e.g. https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=70de24bf68bee5f644e3
Some of issues that syzkaller generated dont have reproducer
If we try to ﬁx such issues, syzkaller failed to verify.
